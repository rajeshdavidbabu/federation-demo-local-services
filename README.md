# Federation Demo Using Local Services
An extension of Apollo Federation Demo using local services instead of running micro-services

https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo enables you to run 4 seperate micro-services and thereby access it through the gateway. But this demo builds all the services while building the ApolloGateway itself using the definition passed.

### Install
npm install

### Start
npm run start-gateway
